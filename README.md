# Circle-The-Dot
One of the games my partner and I made during our first year computing course. Based on Apple's puzzler. All coded in Java using
the Model-View-Controller algorithm. 

How to play: 
The game starts off with a random set of yellow dots and a blue dot somewhere in the center. Every dot you select becomes
yellow, meaning the blue dot cannot pass it, but each time you select a dot the blue dot moves one step closer to the edge finding for
itself the fastest possible route to the edge. Your goal is to trap the blue dot with enough yellow dots so that it can never reach an edge.
